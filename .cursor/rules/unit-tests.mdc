# Unit tests

Split up the unit test in three stages: Arrange, Act
and Assert. Inside Arrange you set up everything that's
needed for the test scenario. In Act you execute the 
scenarion, this is usually just a single line of code,
but not always. And in Act you assert the results of
that action.

```ts
test("some example test", () => {
  // ARRANGE
  const someNumber = 40;

  // ACT
  const result = add(2, someNumber);

  // ASSERT
  expect(result).toBe(42);
})
```
